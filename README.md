# Springboard-Capstone-Project-2

## Introduction

Bike Sharing System is a modern way to rent bikes and its commonly used in metropolitan cities like San Francisco, New York City, and Washington DC. The process of obtaining membership, renting and returning bikes is automated through networks throughout the city. Using these systems, people can rent a bike from one place and return it to another as needed. Currently, there are more than 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide.

These systems generate a lot of data related to the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed, which is very useful for study city mobility. Also, understand how the factors (like weather, traffic, hourly/daily trend) affect the number of bike rentals will help the company make a better business strategy.

## Objective

In this project, I will use the SF Bay Area Bike Share dataset https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share
1. Data Wrangling - explore and merge all datasets together, make a new data frame ready to analyze.
2. Data Exploratory Analysis based on a new data frame and see what is the relationship between each factor and the total daily trips.
3. Feature engineering to get the best features which affect the daily trips most. 
4. Find the best model to predict daily trips in SF on a selected station.

## Results

In this project, I have made a good model to predict daily trips that will take with the bike-sharing service at a particular station. The mean absolute error of my model is about 11 times a day. 
The company could use my model to predict any station usage they are looking for and get a good rough estimate of the dock account they should keep for each day.

To make the model more accurate and usable, The next step I will focus on the larger number of trips, try to figure out what features affect the numbers and how to optimize the model to make better predictions on those particular days.
